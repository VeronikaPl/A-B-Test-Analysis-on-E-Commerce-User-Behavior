### A/B Test Analysis on E-Commerce User Behavior
Exploring e-commerce user behavior through A/B testing with Python, statistics, and visualization.


📌 This project analyzes a simulated A/B test dataset from an online product platform.
The experiment tested whether adding an extra payment option (PayPal) improved the user conversion funnel and overall revenue.

The goal was to evaluate the effect of the change on conversion rates across different funnel stages and provide data-driven recommendations.


🛠️ **Tools & Technologies**

- Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, seaborn)

- Statistical hypothesis testing (Chi-square test, t-test)

- Data cleaning and visualization


🔑 **Key Steps**

- Data preparation and cleaning

- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

- Funnel conversion rate analysis

- Hypothesis formulation and statistical testing

- Visualization of results and insights


📈 **Conclusion**

The A/B test confirms that **adding PayPal as an additional payment option on the credit card form significantly improves the payment conversion rate** and has a positive impact on ARPU. The test results demonstrate statistically significant improvements in both key metrics.

Segment analysis showed that North American users and Windows 11 Home users benefited the most.
